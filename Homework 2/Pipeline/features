	Assumes a that a pandas dataframe is passed.

	Takes:
		dataframe, a pandas dataframe 
		feature, the feature that should be discretized, this procedure will 
			throw observations of a feature into "bins"
		num_bins, an integer indicating the number of bins to create
		bin_type, a string indicating type if bins:
			interval, will create equal interval bins
			frequency, will create equal frequency bins

			throw observations of a feature into "bins"
		categories, a list of the categories we want to create (which should be
			valid values of feature)
